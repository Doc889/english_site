Числа, даты и время (Numbers, Dates, and Time)

Слушай, числа, даты и время — это то, что ты используешь КАЖДЫЙ ДЕНЬ.

Который час?
Когда встреча?
Сколько это стоит?

В английском есть свои правила для этого, и они немного отличаются от русского.

Давай разберёмся.

Главное про числа, даты и время

Числа в английском делятся на:
- Количественные (one, two, three) — сколько
- Порядковые (first, second, third) — какой по счёту

Даты читаются особым образом.

Время — тоже со своими правилами.

Числа от 1 до 20

Эти числа нужно просто запомнить:

1 — one
2 — two
3 — three
4 — four
5 — five
6 — six
7 — seven
8 — eight
9 — nine
10 — ten

11 — eleven
12 — twelve
13 — thirteen
14 — fourteen
15 — fifteen
16 — sixteen
17 — seventeen
18 — eighteen
19 — nineteen
20 — twenty

💡 Совет:
От 13 до 19 добавляем -teen

Десятки

20 — twenty
30 — thirty
40 — forty
50 — fifty
60 — sixty
70 — seventy
80 — eighty
90 — ninety

💡 Совет:
Десятки заканчиваются на -ty

Двузначные числа:

21 — twenty-one
35 — thirty-five
47 — forty-seven
99 — ninety-nine

Сотни и тысячи

100 — one hundred / a hundred
200 — two hundred
1,000 — one thousand / a thousand
10,000 — ten thousand

Примеры:

256 — two hundred fifty-six
1,543 — one thousand five hundred forty-three

💡 Совет:
В английском НЕ используют "and" после сотен:
256 = two hundred fifty-six (не two hundred AND fifty-six)

Порядковые числительные

Порядковые числительные — это «первый», «второй», «третий».

Особые формы (нужно запомнить):

1st — first
2nd — second
3rd — third

Остальные: добавляем -th:

4th — fourth
5th — fifth
6th — sixth
7th — seventh
8th — eighth
9th — ninth
10th — tenth

11th — eleventh
12th — twelfth
20th — twentieth
21st — twenty-first
30th — thirtieth
100th — one hundredth

Даты

Даты в английском говорятся с порядковыми числительными:

5 June = the fifth of June / June fifth

22 March = the twenty-second of March / March twenty-second

Как писать:

Предлог: on
