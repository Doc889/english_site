Be going to (Конструкция be going to)

Слушай, конструкция be going to — это один из САМЫХ ВАЖНЫХ способов говорить о будущем в английском.

В русском мы говорим:
Я собираюсь купить машину.
Я планирую поехать в Москву.
Я думаю пойти в кино.

В английском для всего этого есть одна крутая конструкция — be going to.

И самое важное — она очень простая и логичная.

Главное про be going to

Be going to используется для:
1. Планов и намерений (то, что мы уже решили сделать)
2. Очевидных предсказаний (когда мы ВИДИМ, что что-то произойдёт)

Формула:
am/is/are + going to + базовый глагол (инфинитив без to)

I am going to study. — Я собираюсь учиться.
She is going to travel. — Она собирается путешествовать.

Что такое конструкция be going to

Be going to = собираться сделать что-то

Это способ говорить о будущем, когда у нас есть ПЛАН или НАМЕРЕНИЕ.

I am going to learn English. — Я собираюсь учить английский.

We are going to visit Paris. — Мы собираемся посетить Париж.

He is going to start a business. — Он собирается начать бизнес.

💡 Совет:
Going to = собираться (будущее время)
НЕ путай с going (идти) — здесь другое значение!

Формула: am/is/are + going to + глагол

Формула проста:

Подлежащее + am/is/are + going to + базовый глагол

I + am + going to + work = I am going to work.
She + is + going to + study = She is going to study.
They + are + going to + travel = They are going to travel.

Примеры:

I am going to buy a car. — Я собираюсь купить машину.

She is going to call you. — Она собирается позвонить тебе.

We are going to watch a movie. — Мы собираемся посмотреть фильм.

They are going to move to London. — Они собираются переехать в Лондон.

💡 Важно:
После going to ВСЕГДА идёт базовый глагол (инфинитив БЕЗ to)!
❌ I am going to to study (неправильно)
✔ I am going to study (правильно)

Утверждения (Affirmative)

Утверждения — это когда мы говорим, что кто-то СОБИРАЕТСЯ что-то сделать.

Формула:
Подлежащее + am/is/are + going to + глагол

I am going to sleep. — Я собираюсь спать.
You are going to win. — Ты собираешься победить.
He is going to leave. — Он собирается уйти.
She is going to cook. — Она собирается готовить.
It is going to rain. — Собирается дождь.
We are going to help. — Мы собираемся помочь.
They are going to arrive. — Они собираются прибыть.

Сокращённые формы:
I'm going to = I am going to
She's going to = She is going to
We're going to = We are going to

Примеры:

I'm going to take a shower. — Я собираюсь принять душ.

He's going to visit his parents. — Он собирается навестить родителей.

We're going to have a party. — Мы собираемся устроить вечеринку.

Отрицания (Negative)

Отрицания — это когда мы говорим, что кто-то НЕ СОБИРАЕТСЯ что-то делать.

Формула:
Подлежащее + am/is/are + NOT + going to + глагол

I am not going to go. — Я не собираюсь идти.
She is not going to come. — Она не собирается приходить.
They are not going to buy it. — Они не собираются это покупать.

Сокращённые формы:
I'm not going to = I am not going to
She isn't going to / She's not going to = She is not going to
We aren't going to / We're not going to = We are not going to

Примеры:

I'm not going to eat this. — Я не собираюсь это есть.

He isn't going to call her. — Он не собирается звонить ей.

We aren't going to wait. — Мы не собираемся ждать.

They're not going to help us. — Они не собираются нам помогать.

💡 Совет:
NOT ставится после am/is/are, но ПЕРЕД going to!

Вопросы (Questions)

Вопросы — это когда мы спрашиваем, СОБИРАЕТСЯ ли кто-то что-то делать.

Формула:
Am/Is/Are + подлежащее + going to + глагол?

Am I going to pass? — Я собираюсь сдать?
Is she going to come? — Она собирается прийти?
Are you going to stay? — Ты собираешься остаться?
Are they going to leave? — Они собираются уйти?

Примеры:

Are you going to study tonight? — Ты собираешься учиться сегодня вечером?

Is he going to join us? — Он собирается присоединиться к нам?

Are we going to meet tomorrow? — Мы собираемся встретиться завтра?

What are you going to do? — Что ты собираешься делать?

Where is she going to live? — Где она собирается жить?

When are they going to arrive? — Когда они собираются прибыть?

💡 Важно:
В вопросах am/is/are выходит ВПЕРЁД (перед подлежащим)!

Когда используем be going to

1. Планы и намерения (то, что мы УЖЕ решили):

I'm going to buy a new phone. — Я собираюсь купить новый телефон.
(Я уже решил это, это мой план)

We're going to move to Spain. — Мы собираемся переехать в Испанию.
(Это наше намерение, мы уже об этом думали)

2. Очевидные предсказания (когда мы ВИДИМ признаки):

Look at those clouds! It's going to rain. — Посмотри на эти тучи! Будет дождь.
(Я вижу тучи — очевидно, что будет дождь)

Watch out! You're going to fall! — Осторожно! Ты сейчас упадёшь!
(Я вижу, что человек сейчас упадёт)

He's going to be late. — Он опоздает.
(Есть признаки, что он опоздает)

💡 Совет:
Be going to = для планов, намерений и очевидных предсказаний.
Ключевое слово — МЫ УЖЕ ЗНАЕМ или ВИДИМ, что это произойдёт.

Отличие от Future Simple (will)

Многие путают be going to и will. Вот главное отличие:

Be going to — для ПЛАНОВ и НАМЕРЕНИЙ:
I'm going to visit my grandma. — Я собираюсь навестить бабушку.
(Я уже решил, это мой план)

Will — для СПОНТАННЫХ решений и обещаний:
I will help you. — Я помогу тебе.
(Я только что решил, это спонтанное решение)

Сравни:

I'm going to eat pizza. — Я собираюсь съесть пиццу.
(Я уже решил заранее)

I will eat pizza. — Я съем пиццу.
(Я только что решил)

Look! It's going to rain. — Смотри! Будет дождь.
(Я вижу признаки — тучи)

I think it will rain tomorrow. — Думаю, завтра будет дождь.
(Это просто моё мнение, предположение)

💡 Ключевое отличие:
Be going to = заранее спланированное действие или очевидное предсказание
Will = спонтанное решение, обещание или простое предположение

Примеры с be going to и will:

A: We don't have any milk.
B: I'm going to buy some. — Я собираюсь купить.
(Я уже планировал это)

A: We don't have any milk.
B: I will buy some. — Я куплю.
(Я только что решил)

Типичные ошибки русскоговорящих

❌ I going to study. → пропущен am/is/are
✔ I am going to study.

❌ She is going study. → пропущено to
✔ She is going to study.

❌ I am going to to work. → лишнее to
✔ I am going to work.

❌ He are going to come. → неправильный глагол to be
✔ He is going to come.

❌ I will going to study. → смешивание will и be going to
✔ I am going to study. ИЛИ I will study.

❌ They is going to play. → is вместо are
✔ They are going to play.

❌ Is she going to goes? → goes вместо базового глагола
✔ Is she going to go?

❌ I'm go to study. → go вместо going
✔ I'm going to study.

💡 Частая ошибка:
Русскоговорящие часто забывают am/is/are или говорят "I will going to", смешивая две конструкции.

Разговорная форма "gonna"

В разговорной речи going to часто звучит как "gonna" [ˈɡɒnə].

I'm gonna do it. = I'm going to do it.
She's gonna call. = She is going to call.
We're gonna win. = We are going to win.

⚠️ Важно:
"Gonna" — это ТОЛЬКО разговорная форма!
В письменной речи и формальных ситуациях используй going to.

Примеры:

I'm gonna buy a car. (разговорная речь)
I am going to buy a car. (правильная письменная форма)

He's gonna be late. (разговорная речь)
He is going to be late. (правильная письменная форма)

Главное про be going to

1️⃣ Формула: am/is/are + going to + глагол
2️⃣ Используется для планов и намерений
3️⃣ Используется для очевидных предсказаний
4️⃣ Отличается от will (plan vs spontaneous decision)
5️⃣ После going to — базовый глагол БЕЗ to
6️⃣ В разговорной речи = gonna
