Глагол to be (am / is / are)

Слушай, если в английском есть одна абсолютно обязательная вещь, то это глагол to be.

Русскоговорящие часто его пропускают, и это нормально — в русском языке мы говорим:

Я студент
Она дома
Мы счастливы

И никакого глагола не используем.

А вот английский так не умеет.
В английском предложение без глагола — не предложение.

И вот тут на сцену выходит to be.

Что такое to be

To be — это глагол «быть».

Но он никогда не выглядит одинаково.
В настоящем времени он меняется в зависимости от лица.

Am / Is / Are

Запоминаем простую таблицу:

I am — я есть

You are — ты / вы есть

He is — он есть

She is — она есть

It is — это есть

We are — мы есть

They are — они есть

Примеры:

I am a student.

She is at home.

They are happy.

👉 Без am / is / are эти предложения просто сломаются.

❌ I a student
❌ She at home
