Past Simple

Слушай, Past Simple — это время, которое описывает события, которые произошли в прошлом и уже закончились.
Для русскоговорящих это кажется проще, чем Present Simple, потому что похоже на наше прошедшее время. Но есть важные тонкости, особенно с неправильными глаголами.

Главная идея: Past Simple = завершенное действие в прошлом.

1. Что такое Past Simple

Past Simple используется когда:
- Действие произошло в прошлом и полностью завершилось
- Есть указание на конкретное время в прошлом (yesterday, last week, in 2015)
- Последовательность действий в прошлом

Примеры:

I visited my grandmother yesterday. (Я навестил бабушку вчера)

She worked in Moscow in 2020. (Она работала в Москве в 2020 году)

They played football last weekend. (Они играли в футбол на прошлых выходных)

💡 Совет:
Past Simple = что-то случилось и закончилось. Это прошлое, которое больше не продолжается.

2. Правильные глаголы (Regular Verbs)

Большинство глаголов образуют Past Simple просто добавляя окончание -ed:

глагол + -ed

Примеры:

work → worked (работал)
play → played (играл)
watch → watched (смотрел)
help → helped (помогал)
clean → cleaned (убирал)

Особые правила написания:

Если глагол заканчивается на -e, добавляем только -d:
live → lived, love → loved, like → liked

Если глагол заканчивается на согласную + y, меняем y на i и добавляем -ed:
study → studied, try → tried, carry → carried

Если глагол из одного слога заканчивается на согласную после короткой гласной, удваиваем согласную:
stop → stopped, plan → planned

💡 Совет:
Большинство глаголов правильные, поэтому просто добавляй -ed!

3. Неправильные глаголы (Irregular Verbs)

Некоторые глаголы не подчиняются правилу -ed. Их нужно просто запомнить.

Основные неправильные глаголы:

go → went (ходить, ехать)
come → came (приходить)
see → saw (видеть)
do → did (делать)
make → made (делать, создавать)
have → had (иметь)
get → got (получать)
give → gave (давать)
take → took (брать)
know → knew (знать)
think → thought (думать)
say → said (говорить, сказать)
tell → told (рассказывать)
find → found (находить)
buy → bought (покупать)
eat → ate (есть)
drink → drank (пить)
write → wrote (писать)
read → read (читать, но произносится как "ред")
speak → spoke (говорить)
teach → taught (учить)
learn → learnt/learned (учиться)
feel → felt (чувствовать)
leave → left (уходить, покидать)
meet → met (встречать)
bring → brought (приносить)
begin → began (начинать)
become → became (становиться)
break → broke (ломать)
choose → chose (выбирать)
hear → heard (слышать)
lose → lost (терять)
pay → paid (платить)
sell → sold (продавать)
send → sent (отправлять)
sit → sat (сидеть)
stand → stood (стоять)
understand → understood (понимать)
win → won (выигрывать)
wear → wore (носить одежду)

💡 Совет:
Неправильные глаголы нужно учить наизусть. Начни с самых частых: go-went, do-did, have-had, see-saw.

4. Утверждения (Affirmative)

Для всех лиц (I, you, he, she, it, we, they) форма глагола одинаковая:

подлежащее + глагол в Past Simple

Примеры:

I worked yesterday. (Я работал вчера)

You visited London last year. (Ты посетил Лондон в прошлом году)

He played football on Sunday. (Он играл в футбол в воскресенье)

She watched a movie. (Она посмотрела фильм)

It rained yesterday. (Вчера шел дождь)

We studied English. (Мы учили английский)

They bought a car. (Они купили машину)

💡 Совет:
В утверждениях не нужен вспомогательный глагол! Просто используй Past Simple форму глагола.

5. Отрицания (Negative)

Для отрицаний используем вспомогательный глагол did + not (didn't):

подлежащее + did not (didn't) + глагол в начальной форме

Примеры:

I didn't work yesterday. (Я не работал вчера)

You didn't visit London. (Ты не посещал Лондон)

He didn't play football. (Он не играл в футбол)

She didn't watch TV. (Она не смотрела телевизор)

It didn't rain yesterday. (Вчера не было дождя)

We didn't study English. (Мы не учили английский)

They didn't buy a car. (Они не купили машину)

💡 Совет:
После didn't глагол всегда в начальной форме (инфинитив без to).
❌ didn't worked → ✔ didn't work
❌ didn't went → ✔ didn't go

6. Вопросы (Questions)

Для вопросов ставим did в начало предложения:

Did + подлежащее + глагол в начальной форме?

Примеры:

Did you work yesterday? (Ты работал вчера?)

Did she visit London? (Она посещала Лондон?)

Did they play football? (Они играли в футбол?)

Did he watch the movie? (Он смотрел фильм?)

Did it rain yesterday? (Вчера был дождь?)

Did we study together? (Мы учились вместе?)

Did I tell you this story? (Я рассказывал тебе эту историю?)

💡 Совет:
В вопросах тоже используем начальную форму глагола после did.
❌ Did you went? → ✔ Did you go?
❌ Did she worked? → ✔ Did she work?

7. Наречия времени для Past Simple

Эти слова показывают, что действие было в прошлом:

yesterday (вчера)

last week/month/year (на прошлой неделе/в прошлом месяце/году)

last Monday/Tuesday (в прошлый понедельник/вторник)

ago (назад): two days ago, a week ago, three years ago

in + год: in 2020, in 1995

when I was young (когда я был молодым)

Примеры в предложениях:

I saw him yesterday. (Я видел его вчера)

She lived in Paris last year. (Она жила в Париже в прошлом году)

They visited us two weeks ago. (Они навестили нас две недели назад)

He worked here in 2019. (Он работал здесь в 2019 году)

We met when I was a student. (Мы встретились, когда я был студентом)

💡 Совет:
Слова-маркеры Past Simple помогают понять, что нужно использовать прошедшее время.

8. Отличие от Present Simple

Present Simple = обычные действия, привычки, факты
Past Simple = завершенные действия в прошлом

Сравнение:

Present Simple: I work every day. (Я работаю каждый день — это привычка)
Past Simple: I worked yesterday. (Я работал вчера — одно конкретное действие)

Present Simple: She lives in Moscow. (Она живет в Москве — сейчас)
Past Simple: She lived in Moscow. (Она жила в Москве — раньше, но сейчас уже нет)

Present Simple: They play football on weekends. (Они играют в футбол по выходным — регулярно)
Past Simple: They played football last Sunday. (Они играли в футбол в прошлое воскресенье — один раз)

💡 Совет:
Если есть yesterday, last, ago — используй Past Simple.
Если есть usually, always, every — используй Present Simple.

9. Типичные ошибки русскоговорящих

Самые частые ошибки при использовании Past Simple:

❌ I goed to school. → неправильная форма go
✔ I went to school.

❌ She didn't came home. → лишнее окончание после didn't
✔ She didn't come home.

❌ Did you saw him? → лишнее окончание после did
✔ Did you see him?

❌ He buyed a car. → неправильная форма buy
✔ He bought a car.

❌ We eated pizza. → неправильная форма eat
✔ We ate pizza.

❌ Yesterday I go to the cinema. → используется Present Simple вместо Past Simple
✔ Yesterday I went to the cinema.

❌ Last week she is in London. → используется to be в Present вместо Past
✔ Last week she was in London.

💡 Совет:
Главная ошибка — использовать неправильную форму глагола или забывать, что после did/didn't нужна начальная форма.

10. Глагол to be в Past Simple

Глагол to be имеет особые формы в прошедшем времени:

I / He / She / It → was
You / We / They → were

Утверждения:

I was at home. (Я был дома)
She was happy. (Она была счастлива)
We were students. (Мы были студентами)
They were in Paris. (Они были в Париже)

Отрицания:

I was not (wasn't) at home.
She was not (wasn't) happy.
We were not (weren't) students.
They were not (weren't) in Paris.

Вопросы:

Was I right? (Я был прав?)
Was she happy? (Она была счастлива?)
Were you at home? (Ты был дома?)
Were they in Paris? (Они были в Париже?)

💡 Совет:
Глагол to be не использует did в Past Simple! Он изменяется на was/were.

Главное про Past Simple

Past Simple = завершенные действия в прошлом

Правильные глаголы: глагол + -ed

Неправильные глаголы нужно запомнить (go-went, see-saw, do-did)

Отрицания: didn't + начальная форма глагола

Вопросы: Did + подлежащее + начальная форма глагола?

Маркеры времени: yesterday, last, ago, in + год

После did/didn't всегда используется начальная форма глагола
