Present Simple

Слушай, Present Simple — это время, которое рассказывает о том, что происходит обычно, а не прямо сейчас.
Русскоговорящим оно сначала кажется странным, потому что в русском мы часто просто говорим глаголом без окончания, а в английском нужно внимательно следить за формой глагола.

Главная идея: Present Simple = факты, привычки, рутина.

1. Утверждения

Правило простое:

I / You / We / They + глагол в обычной форме

He / She / It + глагол + -s / -es

Примеры:

I play football. (Я играю в футбол — обычно, каждый день)

She plays tennis. (Она играет в теннис — не прямо сейчас, а регулярно)

They live in London.

💡 Совет:
Не забудь добавить -s / -es к глаголу, если подлежащее he / she / it.

He works, She watches, It rains

2. Отрицания

Чтобы сказать, что что-то не происходит, используем do not / does not:

I / You / We / They → do not (don’t) + глагол

He / She / It → does not (doesn’t) + глагол

Примеры:

I don’t like coffee.

She doesn’t watch TV.

They don’t play basketball.

💡 Совет:
Не ставим -s на глагол после doesn’t!
❌ She doesn’t likes → правильно: She doesn’t like

3. Вопросы

Чтобы спросить, что кто-то делает обычно, меняем порядок:

Do + I/you/we/they + глагол?

Does + he/she/it + глагол?

Примеры:

Do you play football?

Does she like pizza?

Do they live here?

💡 Совет:
В вопросах и отрицаниях глагол не получает -s, если используется does.

4. Наречия частоты

Наречия частоты показывают как часто что-то происходит:

always (всегда)

usually (обычно)

often (часто)

sometimes (иногда)

never (никогда)

Положение в предложении:

Перед глаголом (кроме to be):

I usually go to school by bus.

She always drinks coffee in the morning.

После to be:

He is always happy.

Типичные ошибки русскоговорящих

❌ She play tennis. → забыли -s
❌ He doesn’t likes pizza. → лишнее -s
❌ Do he work here? → должно быть Does he work here?

✔ She plays tennis.
✔ He doesn’t like pizza.
✔ Does he work here?

Главная мысль про Present Simple

Для I/You/We/They — глагол без -s

Для He/She/It — глагол + -s / -es

Отрицания и вопросы строятся через do / does
