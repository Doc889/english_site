Вопросительные слова (Question Words)

Слушай, вопросительные слова — это слова, с которых начинается почти ЛЮБОЙ вопрос в английском.

В русском мы тоже так делаем:
Что ты делаешь?
Где ты живёшь?
Когда ты придёшь?
Как дела?

В английском для этого есть специальные слова.

И самое крутое — их всего несколько, и запомнить их легко.

Главное про вопросительные слова

Вопросительные слова ставятся В НАЧАЛЕ вопроса.

What do you do? — Что ты делаешь?
Where do you live? — Где ты живёшь?

Основные вопросительные слова (5W + 1H):
- What (что)
- Where (где)
- Who (кто)
- When (когда)
- Why (почему)
- How (как)

What (что, какой)

What — используем, чтобы узнать информацию о вещах, действиях.

What is this? — Что это?

What do you do? — Что ты делаешь? (Чем занимаешься?)

What is your name? — Как тебя зовут?

What time is it? — Который час?

💡 Совет:
What = что, какой

Примеры:

What do you like? — Что тебе нравится?

What is your job? — Какая у тебя работа?

What are you doing? — Что ты делаешь?

What colour is it? — Какого это цвета?

Where (где, куда)

Where — используем, чтобы узнать МЕСТО.

Where do you live? — Где ты живёшь?

Where is the bank? — Где банк?

Where are you? — Где ты?

Where are you going? — Куда ты идёшь?

💡 Совет:
Where = где, куда (про место)

Примеры:

Where do you work? — Где ты работаешь?

Where are my keys? — Где мои ключи?

Where is he from? — Откуда он?

Who (кто)

Who — используем, чтобы узнать о ЛЮДЯХ.

Who is this? — Кто это?

Who are you? — Кто ты?

Who is your friend? — Кто твой друг?

Who lives here? — Кто здесь живёт?

💡 Совет:
Who = кто (про людей)

После who глагол часто в 3-м лице:
Who lives here? (не "who live")

Примеры:

Who is she? — Кто она?

Who do you love? — Кого ты любишь?

Who called me? — Кто мне звонил?

💡 Совет:

Why (почему)

Why — используем, чтобы узнать ПРИЧИНУ.

Why not? — Почему нет?

💡 Совет:
Why = почему (про причину)

Ответ часто начинается с Because (потому что):

Примеры:

Why do you like it? — Почему тебе это нравится?

Why is he angry? — Почему он злой?

Why did you leave? — Почему ты ушёл?

Why don't you try? — Почему ты не попробуешь?

How (как, каким образом)

How — используем, чтобы узнать СПОСОБ, СОСТОЯНИЕ.

How are you? — Как дела?

How do you do this? — Как ты это делаешь?

How old are you? — Сколько тебе лет?

How much is it? — Сколько это стоит?

💡 Совет:
How = как, каким образом

How + прилагательное = более специфичный вопрос:
How old? (сколько лет)
How much? (сколько, цена)
How many? (сколько, количество)

Примеры:

How do you know? — Откуда ты знаешь?

How is your mother? — Как твоя мама?

How did you learn? — Как ты научился?

How far is it? — Как далеко это?
