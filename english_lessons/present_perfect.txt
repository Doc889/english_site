Present Perfect (Настоящее Совершённое время)

Слушай, Present Perfect — это одно из САМЫХ ВАЖНЫХ времён в английском.

Русские часто его боятся, потому что в русском языке такого времени нет.

Но на самом деле всё просто, если понять логику.

Present Perfect нужен, когда ты говоришь про действие в ПРОШЛОМ, которое СВЯЗАНО С НАСТОЯЩИМ.

Главное про Present Perfect

Present Perfect — это про прошлое, которое ВАЖНО СЕЙЧАС.

I have finished my work. — Я закончил работу (и сейчас свободен).

She has lost her keys. — Она потеряла ключи (и до сих пор не нашла).

Формула простая:
have/has + Past Participle (третья форма глагола)

Что такое Present Perfect

Present Perfect — это время, которое соединяет прошлое с настоящим.

Мы используем его, когда:
1. Действие произошло, НО ВАЖЕН РЕЗУЛЬТАТ СЕЙЧАС
2. Время не указано (или не важно)
3. Опыт в жизни (ever, never)

I have seen this film. — Я видел этот фильм (в своей жизни).

He has broken his leg. — Он сломал ногу (и она до сих пор сломана).

They have moved to London. — Они переехали в Лондон (и живут там сейчас).

💡 Главное:
Present Perfect = прошлое + связь с настоящим

Формула: have/has + Past Participle

Формула Present Perfect:

have/has + Past Participle (V3)

I/You/We/They + HAVE + V3
He/She/It + HAS + V3

Примеры:

I have worked. — Я поработал.
She has eaten. — Она поела.
They have arrived. — Они приехали.

💡 Важно:
Past Participle — это 3-я форма глагола.

Правильные глаголы: work → worked
Неправильные глаголы: see → seen, go → gone, eat → eaten

Утверждения (Affirmative)

Утвердительная форма:

I have finished.
You have learned.
He has gone.
She has called.
It has stopped.
We have done it.
They have arrived.

Примеры:

I have finished my homework. — Я закончил домашку.

She has called you three times. — Она звонила тебе три раза.

We have lived here for 5 years. — Мы живём здесь 5 лет.

💡 Сокращения:
I have = I've
He has = He's
They have = They've

Отрицания (Negative)

Отрицательная форма:

have/has + NOT + V3

I have not (haven't) seen him.
She has not (hasn't) finished.
They have not (haven't) arrived.

Примеры:

I haven't done my homework yet. — Я ещё не сделал домашку.

He hasn't called me. — Он мне не звонил.

We haven't been to Paris. — Мы не были в Париже.

💡 Сокращения:
have not = haven't
has not = hasn't

Вопросы (Questions)

Вопросительная форма:

Have/Has + подлежащее + V3?

Have you finished?
Has she called?
Have they arrived?

Примеры:

Have you ever been to London? — Ты когда-нибудь был в Лондоне?

Has he done his homework? — Он сделал домашку?

Have they arrived yet? — Они уже приехали?

Краткие ответы:

Yes, I have. / No, I haven't.
Yes, she has. / No, she hasn't.

Когда используем Present Perfect

Present Perfect используем в следующих случаях:

1. Опыт в жизни (ever, never):
I have been to Japan. — Я был в Японии (в жизни).

2. Результат в настоящем:
She has lost her phone. — Она потеряла телефон (и не может найти).

3. Недавнее прошлое (just):
I have just finished. — Я только что закончил.

4. Незаконченный период (today, this week):
I have seen him today. — Я видел его сегодня.

5. Длительность до настоящего (for, since):
We have lived here for 5 years. — Мы живём здесь 5 лет.

Already, yet, just, ever, never

Важные слова-маркеры Present Perfect:

JUST (только что):
I have just arrived. — Я только что приехал.

ALREADY (уже — в утверждениях):
She has already finished. — Она уже закончила.

YET (ещё, уже — в вопросах и отрицаниях):
Have you finished yet? — Ты уже закончил?
I haven't finished yet. — Я ещё не закончил.

EVER (когда-нибудь — в вопросах):
Have you ever been to Paris? — Ты когда-нибудь был в Париже?

NEVER (никогда):
I have never seen this film. — Я никогда не видел этот фильм.

💡 Позиция:
just, already, never — перед Past Participle
yet — в конце предложения
ever — в вопросах перед Past Participle

For и since (длительность)

FOR — как долго (период времени):
for 5 years — 5 лет
for 2 months — 2 месяца
for a week — неделю

I have worked here for 3 years. — Я работаю здесь 3 года.

SINCE — с какого момента (точка во времени):
since 2020 — с 2020 года
since Monday — с понедельника
since yesterday — со вчерашнего дня

She has lived here since 2015. — Она живёт здесь с 2015 года.

💡 Важно:
for + период (for 5 years)
since + момент времени (since 2020)

Отличие от Past Simple

Present Perfect vs Past Simple — главная путаница для русских!

PAST SIMPLE — когда указано время в прошлом:
I saw him yesterday. — Я видел его вчера.

PRESENT PERFECT — когда время не указано или не важно:
I have seen this film. — Я видел этот фильм.

PAST SIMPLE — законченное действие в прошлом:
I lived in London in 2015. — Я жил в Лондоне в 2015.

PRESENT PERFECT — связь с настоящим:
I have lived in London for 5 years. — Я живу в Лондоне 5 лет.

💡 Правило:
Указано КОГДА (yesterday, last week, in 2015) = Past Simple
НЕ указано когда или важен результат = Present Perfect

Маркеры времени:

Past Simple: yesterday, last week, ago, in 2015
Present Perfect: just, already, yet, ever, never, for, since, today, this week
