Настоящее продолженное время (Present Continuous)

Слушай, Present Continuous — это время, которое показывает, что действие происходит ПРЯМО СЕЙЧАС.

В русском мы говорим:
Я читаю (сейчас)
Она спит (в данный момент)
Они играют (прямо сейчас)

А в английском для этого есть специальное время: Present Continuous.

Главное про Present Continuous

Present Continuous = действие происходит СЕЙЧАС, В ДАННЫЙ МОМЕНТ.

Формула: to be + глагол с -ing

I am reading. — Я читаю (сейчас).
She is sleeping. — Она спит (сейчас).
They are playing. — Они играют (сейчас).

Как образуется Present Continuous

Берём три составляющих:

1️⃣ Подлежащее (I, you, he, she...)
2️⃣ Форму to be (am, is, are)
3️⃣ Глагол + окончание -ing

Формула: подлежащее + am/is/are + глагол-ing

Примеры:

I am working. — Я работаю (сейчас).
You are studying. — Ты учишься (сейчас).
He is eating. — Он ест (сейчас).
She is sleeping. — Она спит (сейчас).
We are watching. — Мы смотрим (сейчас).
They are playing. — Они играют (сейчас).

Как добавить -ing к глаголу

Большинство глаголов: просто добавляем -ing

work → working
play → playing
read → reading
watch → watching

Глаголы на -e: убираем -e, добавляем -ing

make → making
write → writing
come → coming
take → taking

Короткие глаголы (согласная-гласная-согласная): удваиваем последнюю букву

run → running
sit → sitting
stop → stopping
swim → swimming

НО: если ударение не на последнем слоге, НЕ удваиваем:
open → opening (не openning)
visit → visiting (не visitting)

💡 Совет:
Большинство глаголов — просто +ing
Только некоторые требуют изменений
