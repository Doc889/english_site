Местоимения — зачем они вообще нужны

Давай сразу честно:
если убрать местоимения, английский развалится.

Ты не сможешь сказать:

кто делает действие

на кого оно направлено

кому что принадлежит

Поэтому местоимения — это не «дополнение», а скелет речи.

Микро-урок 1. Личные местоимения (Subject Pronouns)

Это кто выполняет действие.

I — я
You — ты / вы
He — он
She — она
It — оно
We — мы
They — они

Главное правило, которое нужно вбить в голову:
👉 в английском предложение без подлежащего почти не существует.

❌ Go to work.
✔ I go to work.

❌ Is student.
✔ She is a student.

Очень важный момент для русскоговорящих

В русском можно сказать:

Пошёл в магазин.

В английском так нельзя.
Ты обязан сказать, кто пошёл.

Микро-урок 2. Объектные местоимения (Object Pronouns)

Теперь смотри:
если личные местоимения — кто делает,
то объектные — на кого направлено действие.

me — меня / мне
you — тебя / тебе
him — его / ему
her — её / ей
it — его / её (не человек)
us — нас / нам
them — их / им

Примеры:

She sees me.

I like him.

They help us.

❌ She sees I.
✔ She sees me.

Микро-урок 3. Притяжательные местоимения — часть 1 (my, your…)

Это чей? чья? чьё?

my — мой
your — твой / ваш
his — его
her — её
its — его / её (для предметов и животных)
our — наш
their — их

Они всегда стоят перед существительным.

✔ my phone
✔ her bag
✔ their house

❌ mine phone
❌ her is bag

Микро-урок 4. Притяжательные местоимения — часть 2 (mine, yours…)

А теперь внимание, здесь часто ломаются.

mine — мой
yours — твой
his — его
hers — её
its — его / её
ours — наш
theirs — их

👉 после них НЕТ существительного.

✔ This phone is mine.
✔ The bag is hers.

❌ mine phone
❌ hers bag

Микро-урок 5. Указательные местоимения (this / that)

Они показывают где и сколько.

this — это (близко, одно)
that — то (далеко, одно)
these — эти (близко, много)
those — те (далеко, много)

Примеры:

This book is interesting.

That car is expensive.

These shoes are new.

Those houses are old.

Типичные ошибки русскоговорящих

❌ She loves I
✔ She loves me

❌ This are my friends
✔ These are my friends

❌ This is mine bag
✔ This is my bag

Что важно вынести из этого топика

1️⃣ В английском всегда есть подлежащее
2️⃣ I ≠ me
3️⃣ my ≠ mine
4️⃣ this / that зависит от расстояния и количества

Если ты это понял — ты уже говоришь намного чище, чем большинство beginners.
