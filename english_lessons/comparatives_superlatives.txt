Сравнительная и превосходная степень прилагательных (Comparatives and Superlatives)

Слушай, когда мы хотим сравнить два предмета или сказать, что один предмет самый-самый, нам нужны степени сравнения.

В русском мы говорим:
большой → больше → самый большой
красивый → красивее → самый красивый

В английском точно так же:
big → bigger → biggest
beautiful → more beautiful → most beautiful

И это одна из самых важных тем в английском!

Главное про степени сравнения

Степени сравнения — это формы прилагательного:

1️⃣ Положительная степень (обычная форма):
big — большой
smart — умный

2️⃣ Сравнительная степень (comparative):
bigger — больше
smarter — умнее
Используется для сравнения ДВУХ предметов

3️⃣ Превосходная степень (superlative):
biggest — самый большой
smartest — самый умный
Используется, когда говорим, что что-то САМОЕ-САМОЕ

Примеры:
This car is big. (положительная)
This car is bigger than that one. (сравнительная)
This is the biggest car in the world. (превосходная)

Сравнительная степень / Comparative

Сравнительная степень используется, чтобы сравнить ДВА предмета.

Структура:

Tom is taller than John. — Том выше, чем Джон.

Или с more:
A + be + more + прилагательное + than + B

This book is more interesting than that one. — Эта книга интереснее, чем та.

💡 Совет:
Всегда используем than (чем) для сравнения.

Примеры:
My car is faster than yours. — Моя машина быстрее твоей.
She is younger than me. — Она моложе меня.
This task is more difficult than the previous one. — Эта задача сложнее предыдущей.

Превосходная степень / Superlative

Превосходная степень используется, когда что-то САМОЕ-САМОЕ из всех.

Или с most:
A + be + the most + прилагательное

ВСЕГДА используем артикль THE перед превосходной степенью!

Примеры:

ОСОБЫЕ ПРАВИЛА написания:

1️⃣ Если прилагательное оканчивается на -e, добавляем только -r/-st:
large → larger → largest
nice → nicer → nicest

2️⃣ Если оканчивается на согласную + гласную + согласную, удваиваем последнюю согласную:
big → bigger → biggest
hot → hotter → hottest
fat → fatter → fattest
