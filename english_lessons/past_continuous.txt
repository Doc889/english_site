Прошедшее продолженное время (Past Continuous)

Слушай, Past Continuous — это время, которое показывает, что действие происходило В ПРОЦЕССЕ в прошлом.

В русском мы говорим:
Я читал (в тот момент)
Она спала (вчера в 8 часов)
Они играли (когда я пришёл)

А в английском для этого есть специальное время: Past Continuous.

Главное про Past Continuous

Past Continuous = действие БЫЛО В ПРОЦЕССЕ в определённый момент в прошлом.

Формула: was/were + глагол с -ing

I was reading. — Я читал (в тот момент).
She was sleeping. — Она спала (в тот момент).
They were playing. — Они играли (в тот момент).

Как образуется Past Continuous

Берём три составляющих:

1️⃣ Подлежащее (I, you, he, she...)
2️⃣ Форму to be в прошедшем времени (was, were)
3️⃣ Глагол + окончание -ing

Формула: подлежащее + was/were + глагол-ing

Примеры:

I was working. — Я работал (в тот момент).
You were studying. — Ты учился (в тот момент).
He was eating. — Он ел (в тот момент).
She was sleeping. — Она спала (в тот момент).
We were watching. — Мы смотрели (в тот момент).
They were playing. — Они играли (в тот момент).

Was или Were?

Это важно!

Was используется с I, he, she, it:

I was reading.
He was working.
She was cooking.
It was raining.

Were используется с you, we, they:

You were studying.
We were watching.
They were playing.

💡 Совет:
Was — для единственного числа (кроме you)
Were — для множественного числа и you

Утверждения в Past Continuous

Полные формы:

I was working.
You were studying.
He was reading.
She was cooking.
It was raining.
We were eating.
They were playing.

Краткие формы (реже используются в прошедшем времени):

I was working. (краткая форма редко используется)
You were studying. (краткая форма редко используется)

Примеры:

I was watching TV at 8 PM yesterday. — Я смотрел телевизор вчера в 8 вечера.
She was talking on the phone when I came. — Она разговаривала по телефону, когда я пришёл.
They were having dinner at 7 o'clock. — Они ужинали в 7 часов.

Отрицания в Past Continuous

Отрицание строится просто: добавляем not после was/were.

I was not working. → I wasn't working.
You were not studying. → You weren't studying.
He was not reading. → He wasn't reading.
She was not cooking. → She wasn't cooking.
We were not eating. → We weren't eating.
They were not playing. → They weren't playing.

💡 Совет:
Две формы сокращения:
You were not / You weren't
He was not / He wasn't

Примеры:

I wasn't watching TV. — Я не смотрел телевизор.
She wasn't talking. — Она не разговаривала.
They weren't playing. — Они не играли.

Вопросы в Past Continuous

Вопросы: ставим was/were ПЕРЕД подлежащим.

Was I working?
Were you studying?
Was he reading?
Was she cooking?
Were we eating?
Were they playing?

Примеры:

Were you watching TV? — Ты смотрел телевизор?
Was she talking on the phone? — Она разговаривала по телефону?
Were they having dinner? — Они ужинали?

Короткие ответы:

Were you working? — Yes, I was. / No, I wasn't.
Was she reading? — Yes, she was. / No, she wasn't.
Were they playing? — Yes, they were. / No, they weren't.

Когда используем Past Continuous

1. Действие было В ПРОЦЕССЕ в определённый момент в прошлом:

I was reading a book at 5 PM yesterday. — Я читал книгу вчера в 5 вечера.
She was sleeping at midnight. — Она спала в полночь.
They were watching TV at 8 o'clock. — Они смотрели телевизор в 8 часов.

2. Два действия происходили ОДНОВРЕМЕННО в прошлом:

While I was reading, she was cooking. — Пока я читал, она готовила.
He was watching TV while his wife was working. — Он смотрел телевизор, пока его жена работала.

3. Длительное действие было ПРЕРВАНО коротким (используем when):

I was sleeping when the phone rang. — Я спал, когда зазвонил телефон.
She was cooking when he arrived. — Она готовила, когда он пришёл.
They were playing football when it started raining. — Они играли в футбол, когда начался дождь.

💡 Правило:
Длительное действие (в процессе) — Past Continuous
Короткое действие (прервало) — Past Simple

4. Описание атмосферы, фона в прошлом:

The sun was shining. Birds were singing. — Светило солнце. Пели птицы.
People were walking in the park. Children were playing. — Люди гуляли в парке. Дети играли.

Слова-указатели Past Continuous

at 5 o'clock yesterday — вчера в 5 часов
at that moment — в тот момент
at midnight — в полночь
at noon — в полдень
all day yesterday — вчера весь день
all evening — весь вечер
all morning — всё утро

when — когда (для Past Simple)
while — пока, в то время как (для Past Continuous)

Примеры:

I was working at 9 AM yesterday. — Я работал вчера в 9 утра.
She was studying all evening. — Она училась весь вечер.
They were sleeping at midnight. — Они спали в полночь.

While или When?

Это очень важное различие!

WHILE (пока, в то время как) — используем с Past Continuous:
While I was reading, she called. — Пока я читал, она позвонила.
While they were playing, it started raining. — Пока они играли, начался дождь.

WHEN (когда) — используем с Past Simple:
I was reading when she called. — Я читал, когда она позвонила.
They were playing when it started raining. — Они играли, когда начался дождь.

💡 Совет:
While + Past Continuous (длительное действие)
When + Past Simple (короткое действие)

Примеры:

While I was sleeping, the phone rang. — Пока я спал, зазвонил телефон.
I was sleeping when the phone rang. — Я спал, когда зазвонил телефон.

Past Simple vs Past Continuous

Это важное различие!

Past Simple — законченное действие в прошлом:
I worked yesterday. — Я работал вчера.

Past Continuous — действие было В ПРОЦЕССЕ в прошлом:
I was working at 5 PM yesterday. — Я работал вчера в 5 вечера.

Сравни:

He played football yesterday. — Он играл в футбол вчера (законченное действие).
He was playing football at 3 PM. — Он играл в футбол в 3 часа дня (был в процессе).

They lived in London. — Они жили в Лондоне (факт из прошлого).
They were living in London in 2010. — Они жили в Лондоне в 2010 году (временная ситуация).

I read a book. — Я прочитал книгу (законченное действие).
