There is / There are

Слушай, конструкция there is / there are — это один из самых простых способов сказать, что что-то существует, находится, есть.

В русском мы просто говорим:
В комнате стол
На улице люди
В холодильнике молоко

А в английском нужна специальная конструкция: there is / there are.

Это не про место (не «там»), а про существование чего-то.

Главное про there is / there are

There is / there are = «есть», «находится», «существует»

Не переводи «there» как «там»!

There is a book on the table. — На столе есть книга (не «там книга»).

Два правила:

1️⃣ There is — для единственного числа
2️⃣ There are — для множественного числа

There is (единственное число)

There is — используем, когда говорим об ОДНОМ предмете.

Утверждения:

There is a cat in the garden. — В саду (есть) кошка.

There is a book on the desk. — На столе (есть) книга.

There is a problem. — Есть проблема.

There is milk in the fridge. — В холодильнике есть молоко.

💡 Совет:
Можно сокращать: there's

There's a cat. = There is a cat.

Примеры:

There is a pen on the table.

There is a car outside.

There is a doctor here.

There are (множественное число)

There are — используем, когда говорим о НЕСКОЛЬКИХ предметах.

Утверждения:

There are two cats in the garden. — В саду (есть) две кошки.

There are books on the desk. — На столе (есть) книги.

There are some problems. — Есть несколько проблем.

There are apples in the basket. — В корзине есть яблоки.

Примеры:

There are three pens on the table.

There are cars outside.

There are many people here.

💡 Совет:
There are нельзя сокращать до there're в письменной речи (хотя в речи так иногда говорят).

Отрицания

Отрицание строится очень просто: добавляем not или no.

There is not (isn't):

There isn't a cat. — Нет кошки.

There isn't any milk. — Нет молока.

There isn't a problem. — Нет проблемы.

There are not (aren't):

There aren't cats. — Нет кошек.

There aren't any apples. — Нет яблок.

There aren't people here. — Здесь нет людей.

Можно использовать no:

There are no apples. = There aren't any apples.

💡 Совет:
No + существительное БЕЗ артикля
There is no book. (не "no a book")
