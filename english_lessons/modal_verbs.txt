Модальные глаголы (Modal Verbs)

Слушай, модальные глаголы — это такие особенные слова, которые показывают твоё отношение к действию.

Не само действие, а именно твоё отношение:
- Ты можешь это сделать? (can)
- Тебе нужно это сделать? (must)
- Тебе стоит это сделать? (should)

В русском мы тоже так делаем:
Я могу плавать
Ты должен учиться
Ему следует отдохнуть

А в английском для этого есть специальные слова — модальные глаголы.

Главное про модальные глаголы

Модальные глаголы — это помощники, которые работают с другими глаголами.

Они показывают:
- способность (can — могу)
- необходимость (must — должен)
- совет (should — следует)
- запрет (mustn't — нельзя)

Три правила работы с модальными глаголами:

1️⃣ После модального глагола идёт обычный глагол БЕЗ частицы to
2️⃣ Модальные глаголы НЕ меняются по лицам (нет -s для he/she/it)
3️⃣ Отрицания и вопросы строятся БЕЗ do/does

Can / Can't

Can — это про способность, умение, возможность.

Переводится как «могу», «умею», «можешь».

Утверждения:

I can swim. — Я умею плавать.

She can speak English. — Она может говорить по-английски.

They can help you. — Они могут тебе помочь.

Отрицания (can't / cannot):

I can't drive. — Я не умею водить.

He can't come today. — Он не может прийти сегодня.

We can't understand. — Мы не можем понять.

Вопросы:

Can you swim? — Ты умеешь плавать?

Can she help me? — Она может мне помочь?

Can they come? — Они могут прийти?

💡 Совет:
Can't = cannot (сокращённая форма)
В разговорной речи почти всегда используют can't.

Примеры использования:

I can play guitar. (умение)

Can I use your phone? (разрешение)

We can go tomorrow. (возможность)

Must / Mustn't

Must — это про необходимость, обязанность.

Переводится как «должен», «нужно», «обязан».

Утверждения:

I must go. — Я должен идти.

You must study. — Ты должен учиться.

He must work. — Он должен работать.

Отрицания (mustn't):

ВАЖНО: mustn't = ЗАПРЕТ (нельзя!)

You mustn't smoke here. — Тебе нельзя здесь курить.

He mustn't be late. — Ему нельзя опаздывать.

They mustn't leave. — Им нельзя уходить.

💡 Совет:
Mustn't ≠ «не должен»
Mustn't = «нельзя», «запрещено»

Если хочешь сказать «не обязан», используй don't have to:
You don't have to come. — Тебе не обязательно приходить.

Вопросы:

Must I go? — Я должен идти?

Must we wait? — Мы должны ждать?

Must she stay? — Она должна остаться?

Should / Shouldn't

Should — это про совет, рекомендацию.

Переводится как «следует», «стоит», «должен бы».

Утверждения:

We should help them. — Нам следует им помочь.

Отрицания (shouldn't):

You shouldn't eat this. — Тебе не следует это есть.

They shouldn't worry. — Им не следует волноваться.

Вопросы:

Should we go? — Нам следует идти?

Should they wait? — Им следует подождать?

💡 Совет:
Should — это мягкий совет, не приказ.
Must — строгая обязанность.
Should — дружеская рекомендация.

Разница между can, must, should

Can — могу (способность, возможность):
I can swim. — Я умею плавать.

Must — должен (строгая необходимость):
I must study. — Я должен учиться.

Should — следует (совет):
I should rest. — Мне следует отдохнуть.

Примеры в контексте:

You must help me! — Ты должен мне помочь! (обязанность)

You should help me. — Тебе следует мне помочь. (совет)
