Предлоги места (Prepositions of Place)

Слушай, предлоги места — это маленькие слова, которые показывают, ГДЕ что-то находится.

В русском мы тоже используем такие слова:
на столе
в комнате
под кроватью
рядом с домом

В английском для этого есть специальные предлоги.

И самое крутое — их не так уж много, и они очень логичные.
